						<p>Shelters is a project that employs multiple platforms and skills to retrieve and document stories of survival during the Lebanon's conflicts.
						</p>
						<p> The premise of the project is that underlying the violence and devastation of the country's conflicts, are acts of humanity, solidarity and creativity without which the nation would have fallen apart completely. Shelters uncovers this history, through a spatial epicenter which is the Bomb Shelter. We are sidestepping archives, and official histories, and offering a narrative layer that is informed only by people and the elements of the space.</p>
						<p>

							In April 2015, Shelters won the Design! Disrupt! <a href=" http://www.mideastcreatives.org/2015-beirut"> award </a>. 

							<p>The idea addresses a gap in proper documentation of human survival and to counterweight an overwhelming predominance of a blood-soaked history, which we feel, is greatly dispiriting to Lebanon's people, particularly its youth. It aims to show that even in our darkest hours, we can be beautiful and creative. This deserves to be paid tribute to. Ultimately, we hope to invoke memories from people, new testimonies that are fit for archiving in the country's libraries.</p>

							<p>Bomb Shelters are likely the only space during the extremely cantonized Civil War that people can collectively remember. It is a testament to the shared struggles, and shared modes of survival of people even when they are worlds apart. In that way, we feel this is an extremely potent collective memory device. In addition, the Shelter, whilst always mentioned in stories, has never been revisited by the vast majority of the population, much less seriously memorialized. 
							</p>

							<p>Nowadays they function as electricity or storage rooms, and exist mostly in memories and not tangibly. Revisiting the shelter is a literal revisiting of Lebanon's underground history.</p>

							<h3>About KnoozRoom </h3> 

							<p>

							KnoozRoom is a multi-disciplinary group that combines narrative, art and code to create stories that are faithful to our collective memory. Because so much of the region's knowledge and history are tucked away in the oral tradition, we believe that participatory story-telling models are key to unlocking our informational treasures.</p>
